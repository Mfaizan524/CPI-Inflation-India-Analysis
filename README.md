It features data cleaning, interactive dashboards, and visualizations to explore inflation patterns and their effects on sectors like food, housing, and services, offering valuable insights for analysts, economists, and decision-makers.

**Project Overview**

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a critical indicator for understanding inflation trends. This project involves analyzing historical CPI data to:

1. Identify inflation patterns over time.

2. Understand how inflation impacts economic sectors and consumers.
   
3. Present data-driven insights through Excel dashboards and visualizations.

**Key Features:**

üìä Interactive Excel Dashboard: Dynamic visualizations with slicers to filter data by year, region, and categories.

üìà Trend Analysis: Time-series charts displaying inflation trends over the years.

üîç Insights Derived: Summarized findings, including high-inflation periods and contributing factors.

üìë Clean Data Preparation: Data cleaning, transformation, and structuring for accurate analysis.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

**Data Cleaning**: Organized raw CPI data for analysis using Excel functions.

**Data Analysis:** Used Excel tools like PivotTables, VLOOKUP,Functions and conditional formatting.

**Visualization:** Created charts, including line charts, bar charts, and pie charts, to visualize inflation trends.

**Storytelling:** Presented findings through a clean and intuitive dashboard.

Problem Statement & Analysis Steps
1. Contribution of Broader Categories to CPI
Combine similar categories (e.g., Food = Meals, Beverages, Cereals).
Calculate and graph the contribution of each broader category to the CPI basket (totaling 100%).
Identify the category with the highest contribution.
2. Year-on-Year (YoY) CPI Trend Analysis (2017 Onwards)
Compute YoY CPI inflation for rural and urban categories.
Plot YoY inflation trends and identify the year with the highest inflation rate.
Research and highlight the reasons for this spike.
3. Retail Inflation Analysis (Nov 2022 ‚Äì May 2023)
Analyze month-on-month inflation for the broader food category.
Identify months with the highest and lowest food inflation.
Determine the biggest individual contributor to inflation within the food category over the 12-month period.
4. Impact of COVID-19 on Inflation (Mar 2020 Onwards)
Compare inflation rates before and after Mar 2020 (pandemic onset).
Focus on key categories like healthcare, food, and essential services.
Highlight inflation trends during major pandemic milestones (e.g., lockdown).
5. Impact of Global Events on Inflation (2021‚Äì2023)
Analyze imported oil price fluctuations (month-on-month).
Identify trends and correlation between oil prices and inflation across all categories.
Highlight the category most influenced by oil price changes.
